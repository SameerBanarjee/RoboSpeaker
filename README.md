# RoboSpeaker
RoboSpeaker is a basic Python Project which is used to speak the particular text entered by the user.

For Windows the project simply uses the python library (pyttsx3) to convert text to speech.  
For MacOS the project will have to import os library and uses .say function to convert text to speech.

Real life application of this project is in the payment merchant speakers like paytm, phonepe, etc.
You might have heard after doing upi payment " Received Paytm Payment of Rupees 100".
